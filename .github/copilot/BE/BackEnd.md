App instructions
---------------
I want to create a Web API for managing user financial transactions.

The API should connect to a SQL Server database using the connection string: Server=(localdb)\mssqllocaldb;Database=Transactionhandler;Trusted_Connection=True;.

It must support full CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations for user transactions.

The API will be used by a web application designed to let users monitor their expenses.

The web application should provide aggregated views of transactions (e.g., total expenses by category, month, or custom filters).
